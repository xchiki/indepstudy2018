It is cross listed at Brown (as CSCI1370) and RISD (as ILLUS3340) and is co-taught by David Laidlaw from Brown Computer Science, Fritz Drury from RISD Illustration, as well as Stephen Gatesy and Morgan Turner from Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Johannes Novotny is the TA.

                            <br><br>Computer science students learn how to work effectively with each other as well as with artists and designers in creating applications targeting Brown's Caves. A Cave is an immersive virtual reality space whose floor and walls are covered with displays, which we will use to create interactive 3D virtual environments. There are currently two Caves on campus that are managed by the Brown Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV): the YURT, a curved display system with 360-degree field of view located at 180 George St., and it's predecessor an 8'x8'x8' cube display system located at Studio 4 of the Granoff Center.

                            <br><br>Artists and designers learn to interact with scientists in designing and realizing applications in this new medium. We study the process of design from several perspectives; learn about some specific scientific problems; study existing applications of scientific visualization and virtual reality; explore the medium of the YURT; create designs for the scientific applications; critique, evaluate, realize, and iterate the designs; and culminate with a demonstration of final projects.</p>

Students work in teams on projects that are defined through discussions with the instructor. An assembled product or detailed design description is the goal of the semester's effort. Students may elect to combine ENGN 1000 with ENGN 1001 to work on a year-long project with permission of the instructor. Students electing to pursue this option must take ENGN 1000 and ENGN 1001 in the same academic year, and must submit a project proposal no later than October 1. Instructor permission required.</p>

These entrepreneurial activities can take place in two contexts: the creation of new organizations; and within existing organizations. This course will present an entrepreneurial framework for these entrepreneurial processes, supported by case studies that illustrate essential elements. Successful entrepreneurs and expert practitioners will be introduced who will highlight practical approaches to entrepreneurial success.</p>

Our mission is to ignite the entrepreneurial spirit of the students on College Hill. Founded in 1998, Brown EP has facilitated a wide array of activities on campus for nearly two decades to bring together like-minded individuals, instill the Brown community with a self-starter mentality, and introduce entrepreneurship as a potential career path. True to Brown's distinctive approach to learning and life, our student-run and university-backed events and programs inspire, educate, and empower the next generation of constructively irreverent leaders. We are powered by the Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship.</p>

                        <p style="width: 700px;">In 1986, Brown President Howard Swearer was at the forefront of a revolution in higher education when he founded one of the first public service centers in the nation, now named for him â€” the Swearer Center, formerly the Swearer Center for Public Service. President Swearer had the foresight to locate the new center within the Dean of the Collegeâ€™s office â€” at the heart of the undergraduate curriculum. He strongly believed, as President Christina Paxson does today, that public service and experiential learning are essential components of Brownâ€™s educational mission.
                        
                        Today, the Howard R. Swearer Center works with more than 1,200 Brown students, through and with 100+ community partners -- more than half of which are in the Greater Providence area. In our 30-year history, we have developed and nurtured many deep â€” and deeply rewarding â€” relationships with individuals and organizations in Providence that continue to inspire us and our work. We connect students, faculty and community partners through community engagement, engaged scholarship and social innovation -- three key perspectives that are the foundations of our work.</p>

                        IECV supports this mission through its three programmatic pillars:  (1) Commercial Venturing:  we partner with Brown researchers to ascertain the market relevance of their discoveries, then forge the best strategy for transitioning from idea to impact and protecting intellectual property as appropriate in support of lab-to-market development plans;  (2) Industry Engagement:  we build strategic relationships with industry centered around research collaborations aimed at spawning innovations of commercial interest to our company partners - while also connecting the companies to Brown faculty and researchers, students, entrepreneurs, and executive education programs;  and (3) Translational Development:  we provide and manage translational development capabilities to help solidify proof of technical feasibility and of commercial relevance, both of which can de-risk an idea or discovery and turn it into more concrete product opportunities that are attractive to potential industry partners or startup creators. </p>
