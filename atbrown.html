We leverage design thinking to tackle the complex challenges facing the world of medicine. As an incubator for innovative ideas, Design+Health encourages students across all disciplines to develop and implement design solutions that address clinical and public health concerns. By supporting student and faculty research initiatives, we seek to couple design solutions with rigorous scientific investigations in order to demonstrate measurable outcomes and facilitate applications in healthcare. Through our combined course, we aim to foster an interdisciplinary culture that embraces the relationship between design and health and to empower students to serve as advocates for improved health outcomes via design.</p>

                            Student teams identify potential new products, conceptualize, package, and define their business mode. By plotting their course across the chasm, we confront the cross-disciplinary barriers to realizing benefits from technology.
