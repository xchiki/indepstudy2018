                                <p>Recently, there has been a bigger appreciation for design. Whether it be institutional support or in industry, design has had a translational impact. This is largely because of the push for human-centered products. Human-centered design methods are widely used to design products that have high usability and promote a positive user experience.

                                        <p>Design thinking is a process where humans seek to solve problems by understanding the user, challenging assumptions and implications, and redefining the problem to identify unique solutions. According to the Stanford d.school, design thinking comprises of the following stages: empathizing with the user, defining a problem statement, ideating/brainstorming, prototyping, and testing things with your user. All of these steps revolve around the user/customer and is “a human centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success” (Turnali). This is an iterative process that is done until there is a solution for an improved future. Design thinking eliminates the fear of failure and largely depends on constraints to design the best possible solution given certain parameters. </p>

                                        <p>Convergent thinking is a problem solving technique that brings togther a wide variety of ideas to determine the best possible solution to a problem. This method focuses on discovering the "right" answer to a problem. For this thinking strategy, it is important to focus on speed, logic, accuracy, and identifying the known to reapplying that knowledge to amass more information. This type of thinking allows for little to no ambiguity. This is the type of thinking one may learn at a conventional school in terms of learning information and applying it to other various problems. Common methods of convergent thinking include: logic thought flow, pattern recognition, standardizing, etc. Convergent thinking can be used to organize ideas generated from divergent thinking tactics. This allows designers to figure out the best solution after considering and debating a multitude of possible solutions. Convergent and divergent thinking may be opposite in definition but can be used in conjunction with each other to produce good design.</p>

                                        <p>Contrary to convergent thinking, divergent thinking is a problem solving strategy that allows for multiple possible solutions in an attempt to discover the one solution that works optimally. It's characterized as being a free-flowing, spontaneous way of thinking. This allows for multiple ideas to be considered and evaluated no matter how unconventional it may seem. Once divergent thinking processes have been completed, these pieces of informaiton and ideas are then organized by using convergent thinking to find the best solution. Divergent thinking allows for out of the box and complex ideas to form. It requires making unexpected connections and combinations while also thinking of simple triggers or ideas in a different way. Some of the elements of divergent thinking include: complexity, curiosity, elaboratoin, flexibility, fluency, imagination, originality, and risk taking. Methods of divergent thinking include bubble mapping, artwork, journaling, subject mapping, and building lists of questions. </p>
