                                <p>Recently, there has been a bigger appreciation for design. Whether it be institutional support or in industry, design has had a translational impact. This is largely because of the push for human-centered products. Human-centered design methods are widely used to design products that have high usability and promote a positive user experience.</p>

                                        <p>Design Thinking is by far the most prevalent of these creative strategies. Design Thinking emerged in the 80’s and 90’s from the classrooms and studios of Stanford and IDEO, and gained considerable popularity in the early years of the 21st century. In its most simple formulation, it might characterized as the scientific method applied to the creative process. It is human centered and iterative. This process moves from the abstract to the concrete through iterative prototyping, from low resolution to high resolution. Design Thinking is often presented as five steps: 1. Empathize, 2. Define the problem, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, 5. Test.

                                        <p>Design Thinking and Human Centered Design are closely related terms. Design Thinking is Human Centered, and Human Centered Design is a close sibling to User Centered Design. These terms are often interchangeable. User Centered Design was popularized in the 1980’s by Don Norman’s seminal book, “The Design of Everyday Things”, in which he urged designers to consider the user experience throughout the entire design process, rather than employing top down “engineering” strategies, which are often framed around technical solutions and ignore the actual needs of stakeholders. Human Centered Design places a high value on design research methods that cultivate empathy with the user. Methods for visual thinking and storytelling are especially important for this kind of collaborative process.</p>
